Inventory Manager for Wig Salon

A desktop management system for wig salons, designed to streamline daily operations such as inventory tracking, customer management, appointments, sales, and repairs.

- WPF (C# and XAML)
- WCF Services
- SQL Server LocalDB
- Entity Framework

Main features:
- Manage wigs, customers, sales, appointments, and repairs
